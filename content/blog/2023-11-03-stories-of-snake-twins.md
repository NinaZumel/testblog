A bit of Filipino folklore I only recently learned about: [snake-twins](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2023/11/03/stories-of-snake-twins/). Yes, people who allegedly were born with snakes for twin siblings. Such people, *kambal-ahas*, can reputedly cure snake bites and other ailments, and communicate with snakes. Sometimes they're said to have other supernatural abilities, too. Fun stuff.
