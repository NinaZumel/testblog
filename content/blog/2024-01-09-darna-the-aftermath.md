Starting up my Filipino comics translation project for the new year. Here's Episode 13 of the Darna saga: [The Aftermath](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2024/01/08/1950s-darna-the-aftermath/).

There are two pages missing in the scan, but Simon Santos at Video48 provided a summary of the missing pages, which I translated and inserted in the issue.
