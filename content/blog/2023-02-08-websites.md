For the last several months, I’ve had this weird urge to build websites. I don’t know why; I’m crap at it — the only way I can do it is to fork other peoples’ repos and painstakingly tweak them to what I want. And I can’t stand up my own server or even connect my jekyll sites to micropub to save my life.

But hey, it’s a creative urge, I guess I’ll go with it. A new bookshelf project possibly in the works. Maybe you’ll see it soon, if I haven’t just jinxed it with this post.
