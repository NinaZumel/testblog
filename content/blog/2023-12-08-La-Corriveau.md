Today's Winter Tale is from Canada!  [*La Corriveau*](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2023/12/08/la-corriveau/) is a story based on the real-life Canadian murderess [Marie-Josephte Corriveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Josephte_Corriveau), whose folkloric reputation is somewhat more colorful than her actual deed might imply.
