I've been watching the current kerfluffle and its aftermath at Micro.blog. I have to say that my immediate reaction to the person who took offense was "welcome to the world the rest of us live in." 

By which I mean so many people who live as a member of a minority group spend a good part of their brain cells constantly deciding to "pick their battles" when someone else says something that bothers or even offends them. And then, if they do say something, having to defend their reaction when the other person says "I didn't mean anything by it...." (and in this case, I do believe the first person didn't "mean anything" insulting by their statement).

It sucks to be in that situation. In an ideal world, we'd never have "-isms". In my opinion, an -ism is bad when it's directed even at member of a privileged class.  But it's not **worse**. And the unstated but definitely acted upon premise is that it is indeed "worse" -- and that is what (greviously) offends me, and I suspect other people as well. 

And now I will shut up and go back to translating Filipino comics.
