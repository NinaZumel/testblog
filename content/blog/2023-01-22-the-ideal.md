> Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? Is the luminous point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces, monstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds. 

Beautiful quote from Victor Hugo on the invincibility of the ideal (and by extension, hope). From [*Les Mis√©rables*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/135), 1887 translation by Isabel F. Hapgood.
