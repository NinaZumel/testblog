The last winter tale for 2023 (but one more coming for 2024): A New Year's eve ghost story from Canada -- a sort of "reverse Christmas Carol." In ["The Miser's Ghost"](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2023/12/31/the-misers-ghost/), a man lost in the snow on New Year's eve seeks shelter at a mysterious cabin he's never seen before.  
  
Enjoy, and Happy New Year, everyone!
