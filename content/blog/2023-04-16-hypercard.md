> James Sime at Isotope Comics (in San Francisco) just released a ["Hypercard Zine"](https://archive.org/details/hypercard_neuroblast-hypercard-diskzine) that speaks to the cyberpunk times we're living in. Hosted at the Internet Archive, running on a vintage classic Mac OS.  (Hypercard was a circa 1987 tech that let people create hypertext documents long before [CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web) published its first HTML page.)
 

From the Borderlands Bookstore newsletter. The 'zine runs on IA's retro game emulator, and it's kinda wonderful.
