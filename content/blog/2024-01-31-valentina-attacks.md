Episode 18 of my Darna translation project [Valentina Attacks](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2024/01/31/1950s-darna-valentina-attacks/). 
  
I found this episode disturbingly violent for a 1950s-era comic. I knew what was going to happen, since I'm reading ahead relative to what I post, but working on it kinda put me in a dark place. Even pre-code E.C. comics, as graphic as the violence might be, is still fairly, well, cartoonish. This, for me, was not.  
  
I'd be curious if other readers react the same way I did.
