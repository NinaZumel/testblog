ðŸ“š [**The Library of Babble**](https://ninazumel.com/books/). My contemplated bookshelf project has indeed started. Rather than a bookshelf of *Reading*, *Want to Read*, and *Finished*, with ratings, this is a shelf of books that I've mentioned on my blog *Multo* over the years.

It's not a shelf of reviews; it's more like a visual representation of the books that have affected my blogging life thus far. Or will, be when I've finished populating it with past books. And there are a lot of straight reviews, especially more recently.

Time breakdown so far:

* Adding the bookshelf: ~2 hours. Someone who's actually conversant with jekyll, liquid, etc would probably have done this in half an hour, but it's done now. I used [`jekyll-bookworm`](https://github.com/subhodeeps/jekyll-bookworm/) for the template.

* Writing the script to generate the individual book docs from a spreadsheet: ~30 min. Easy-peasy.

* Populating the spreadsheet: ongoing, since I have to go through my blog and fill out the spreadsheet manually.

* Polishing the auto-generated docs: ongoing. I suppose I could skip this step, but I'm obsessive that way.

I also added categories and tags to the books; `jekyll-bookworm` doesn't use them, but eventually I want to organize the bookshelf by category, rather than year. Again, that would probably take a few minutes for someone who knows what they're doing, but it will  take me a little longer. But first to finish populating the shelf; one step at a time.
