Winter themed ghost stories keep coming until Epiphany! The first of two for New Year's weekend is ["The Ghostly Rental"]([https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2023/12/29/the-ghostly-rental/](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2023/12/29/the-ghostly-rental/)) by Henry James, about a house that's being rented out---to a ghost!  

This is early James, during his "readable" period, so even if you hate late James, you still might enjoy this one.
