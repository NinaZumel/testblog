ðŸ“š ["The Eternal Stooge"](https://exiw.wordpress.com/2023/04/23/the-eternal-stooge/)  is a devil's bargain tale (text, not graphic art) that I found in a remaindered collection[^1] of Pre-Code horror comics. Most prose tales in comic books are pretty forgettable, but this one was cute, so I transcribed it.

The frustrated straight-man to a famous comedian longs for a serious acting career. He sees his chance in a new Broadway production of Marlowe's *Dr. Faustus*. But perhaps he should have waited for a play with a happier ending....
