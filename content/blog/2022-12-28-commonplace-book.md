📓 📝 I've started keeping a commonplace book for inspirational things I find online. I'm using [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). Usually, I copy/paste the article or excerpt directly in, and add a link to the source. Sometimes, I'll use Scrivener's "import from the web" research feature. Scrivener lets me attach my own notes to the documents as well.

It's not fancy; it's not in the cloud. But it's slightly more organized than saving stuff as browser bookmarks or reading lists, which is what I used to do. And I love Scrivener; I use it so many ways. I think this will work.
