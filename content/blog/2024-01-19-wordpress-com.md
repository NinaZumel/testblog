So wordpress.com won't admit my website exists, except when it does. Meaning, you can see it, you can email or RSS subscribe to it (and get notifications), but it won't show up in the wordpress.com reader if you aren't subscribed.

Ironically, I discovered this when someone tried to *unsubscribe*, and couldn't because "the site doesn't exist". 

I emailed support; they read the (unhelpful) web-available doc pages back at me. Nice.

I suspect it's a shadowban because I've been unthinkingly profligate with links in recent posts. My fault, and I will stop, but I'd like them to confirm to me they did that, and undo it, please, before I start screaming paranoid accusations at support.

(PS, I'm talking about *multoghost.wordpress.com*, not *ninazumel.com*, which is on Github Pages.)
