I've been streaming music from [BayBeats](https://baybeats.sfpl.org/albums), a (curated) music streaming service sponsored by the San Francisco Public Library, featuring music by local SF Bay Area artists. It's free to the public, but you need an SFPL library card to download. It's been a great way to discover local artists I didn't know about. I hope other municipalities start doing the same thing, too.
