ðŸ“š  Picked up a copy of [_Creeps by Night_](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1027309), a 1931 anthology of spooky and macabre short stories, edited by Dashiell Hammett. My 1944 edition has 20 stories, plus an intro by Hammett, like the 1931 edition does; later reprints only include ten stories. So it was worth doing the research before dropping the hammer on biblio.com. I'm curious to check out his selection.

My edition is from World Publishing, who also released two "terror tale" anthologies by Boris Karloff, [_Tales of Terror_](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2019/05/31/boris-karloff-terror-tale-anthologist/) from 1943, and [_And the Darkness Falls_](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/karloffs-and-the-darkness-falls/) from 1946. They're both good, but I really enjoyed _And the Darkness Falls_; just a great selection. I hope the Hammett is a winner, too.
