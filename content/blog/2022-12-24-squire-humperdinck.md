📚 On Christmas Eve, I always post a lighter winter tale: [Squire Humperdinck and the Devil](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2022/12/24/squire-humperdinck-and-the-devil/) is a delightful fairy tale about a greedy landowner and a mischievous little boy who foils the squire's evil plans. Happy Holidays, and enjoy!
