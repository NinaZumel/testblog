Do not be daunted <br>
by the enormity<br>
of the world's grief. <br>
Do justly, now. <br>
Love mercy, now. <br>
Walk humbly, now. <br>
You are not obligated <br>
to complete the work, <br>
but neither are you free <br>
to abandon it. <br>


Commonly attributed to The Talmud. Attributed [here](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3256117.Annesley_William_Streane) to [Annesley William Streane](https://4enoch.org/wiki5/index.php/Annesley_William_Streane_(1844-1915),_scholar) (1844-1915), a Cambridge scholar and Old Testament translator and commentator.

[This source](https://reformjudaism.org/beliefs-practices/spirituality/3-jewish-reminders-when-world-seems-overwhelming) attributes the quote to [Rabbi Tarfon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Tarfon), in the *Pirkei Avot*, commenting on *Micah* 6:8. See also this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2d1w2k/quote_from_the_talmud_do_you_know_where/). So I suppose the quote must be from Streane's translation of Tarfon's commentary.

Either way, it's a beautiful passage.
