So I found an early translation of the Byland Abbey ghost stories (first published by M.R. James in 1922) on Github, of all places. So of course I had to fork the repo to [make a more online readable version](https://github.com/NinaZumel/TwelveMedievalGhostStories/blob/master/English/english.md). Because that's what I do. 

They are fun, though.
