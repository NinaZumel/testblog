## Things I've Learned from Reading Ghost Stories:

* If the rent or sale price seems too good to be true - it is.

* Don’t blow old whistles.

* Found an ancient artifact? And it’s got a Latin inscription? _Don’t_ read it out loud!

* Ditto for old books.

* Just put it back where you found it. Seriously.

* Beware of “persons” in flappy flowy hooded garments.

* Beware your child’s “imaginary playmate.”

* If the mirrors are covered - leave them that way.

* Ditto for paintings.

* Ditto for plastered-over murals.

* Never scoff at “old wives tales.”

* There is no cat in the house.
