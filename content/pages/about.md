  <h3>Welcome</h3>

    I'm Nina, and *Short Thoughts* is my personal microblog. I use it to share what I've written across all my long-form blogs, and to post quick little musings.

    If you're curious, you can find out more about me at [*NinaZumel.com*](https://ninazumel.com).

    I don't do regular social media, but you can follow [@MultoGhost](https://micro.blog/MultoGhost) at Micro.blog (which syndicates this site), or follow me here directly via RSS. 
    
    If you want to reply to any of my posts here, you can do that by joining Micro.blog, or sending an email (see the link below). You can leave a comment on my long form articles at the originating blog.

    <h3>My Blogs</h3>

    [**Multo(Ghost)**](https://multoghost.wordpress.com): my primary blog, where I blog about the supernatural in literature and popular culture. You'll find ghost stories, folklore, and whatever I feel like writing about.

    [**Ephemera**](https://exiw.wordpress.com): Lately, I've been using this blog mostly for my translations of public domain, Spanish language supernatural short fiction.

    [**Dark Tales Sleuth**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com): A blog I use for my forays into "literary sleuthing": tracking down author attributions and original publication sources of unattributed (usually public domain) works.

    [**NinaZumel.com**](https://ninazumel.com): My professional presence online, where I sometimes write about data science and other technical interests.
