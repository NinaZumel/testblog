			"content_html": "<p>I keep seeing these articles everywhere now about how Google results are getting SO MUCH worse. So terrible! So many splogs! I stopped using Google as my primary search engine a long time ago, in favor of DuckDuckGo -- more because I don't like Google's invasiveness and spying than anything else -- but I do occasionally go back to Google when DuckDuckGo fails me. And to be honest, I can't say that I've noticed what other people complain about, at least not so dramatically (though I do agree that searches that used to succeed, like for exact long quotes, no longer do).</p>\n<p>There's a lot of possible reasons for this. I might just be a slowly boiling frog, and haven't realized it yet. I might have learned to unconsciously and automatically skim past junk results (I find I often skip right over the top result). I'm never logged into Google. I always clear my cookies and cache when I log out of my brower. I use uBlock Origin. It might just be the kind of stuff I search for, or the way I query. Who knows?</p>\n<p>But I from all these articles, and the associated comment threads, I've found a lot of alternative search engines, and I tried a few. I've started using <a href=\"https://www.startpage.com/\">Startpage</a> as my Google proxy, for more anonymity. I've found that the results are not the same as directly querying Google, but they are pretty good and sometimes better (less sploggy, even). DuckDuckGo and Startpage/Google are still my go-tos, but I've added a few more back-up engines, too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mojeek.com/\">Mojeek</a> has its own search index. <a href=\"https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/\">sierdy</a> called this the best alternative to the Google-Bing-Yandex index trifecta. I'd call it good, not great. Seems to surface mostly older pages (which can be useful sometimes). Has advanced search (remember that?), and a beta-version Substack specific search engine, which I haven't tried. Less good for <em>what's the answer?</em>, better for <em>what else is out there?</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.marginalia.nu/\">Marginalia</a> is maybe more interesting than &quot;useful,&quot; depending on why you are browsing. It focuses on indexing the &quot;small web,&quot; and as the developer says:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s perhaps not the greatest at finding what you already knew was there. Instead it is designed to help you find some things you didn’t even know you were looking for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's another <em>what else is out there?</em> kind of search engine, and while I don't lean on it much, I always click through to it (Firefox makes it easy to cycle a query through multiple search engines), just to see what's there.</p>\n<p>The same developer made a <a href=\"https://explore2.marginalia.nu/\">Similar Website Finder</a> which is also kind of fun. Type your own website in and see what it suggests!</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, <a href=\"https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/\">sierdy's page of alternative search indexes</a> that I link to above is quite informative and interesting. Do check it out.</p>\n",

This is a blog I put up to support my projects in literary sleuthing: that is, tracking down proper author/translator attributions and provenance of uncredited (or miscredited) stories---a thing you come across a lot if you like to read short fiction from nineteenth century periodicals or anthologies. The amount of copypasta and plagiarism is staggering. Even the <em>New York Times</em> wasn't above it.</p>\n<p>The story in question was one I'd identified as probably being an English translation of a story from a Danish literary journal, that was possibly itself a translation from another language. Maybe even English? That would be funny. Thanks to leads my commenter gave me, I did find a German version of the story that may be the original. Maybe. And <a href=\"https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2024/01/01/revisiting-the-tigers-cave/\">I wrote about it here</a>.</p>\n<p>Not that I expect anyone to be interested in the story itself -- to be honest, even I don't like it. But literary sleuthing is a fun form of internet research and puzzle solving: running down virtual rabbit holes, figuring out exactly what query---and on which search engine---will get what you want, finding all kinds of cool archives you didn't know about before.... It's some of the same impulse, perhaps, that motivates people who like dig into true crime, or into internet drama: can I find something no one else has? Can I see or think of what no one else has seen or thought of?</p>\n<p>Literary sleuthing is less salacious, but also more benign: after all, everyone involved is long gone, and no living person's reputation can be harmed. It's just a harmless intellectual pasttime. At any rate, I like doing it, and I like reading about other people doing it, and maybe you will, too.</p>\n",

Rather than a bookshelf of <em>Reading</em>, <em>Want to Read</em>, and <em>Finished</em>, with ratings, this is a shelf of books that I've mentioned on my blog <em>Multo</em> over the years.</p>\n<p>It's not a shelf of reviews; it's more like a visual representation of the books that have affected my blogging life thus far.

And there are a lot of straight reviews, especially more recently.</p>\n<p>Time breakdown so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Adding the bookshelf: ~2 hours. Someone who's actually conversant with jekyll, liquid, etc would probably have done this in half an hour, but it's done now. I used <a href=\"https://github.com/subhodeeps/jekyll-bookworm/\"><code>jekyll-bookworm</code></a> for the template.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writing the script to generate the individual book docs from a spreadsheet: ~30 min.

Originally, it was in Scrivener on my desktop, which is my primary machine for work and for my writing.</p>\n<p>But I also do a lot of my leisure-time online reading on my laptop, and my Scrivener commonplace book wasn't in the cloud. At first, I'd save links to interesting articles to Apple Notes, and put them in Scrivener the next time I was at my desktop, but that got old really fast.</p>\n<p>So I've moved from Scrivener to <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/\">bookdown</a>, which generates an HTML book from Rmarkdown that I can peruse locally from my browser.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://ninazumel.com/short_thoughts/assets/images/commonplace_book.png\" alt=\"Commonplace Book\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p>Bookdown is overkill; I don't need any R functionality, nor do I need to generate the book in PDF or EPUB, or any other format that bookdown supports. Probably <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/\">mdBook</a> would have made more sense. But R and the RStudio IDE are already on both my laptop and desktop, and it's nice to just create a new Rmarkdown file and press &quot;Build.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now I can add to my clippings from either machine, and keep the book synchronized with a private repository on GitHub. And I can read it from both places, too, which is a bonus I hadn't been planning on when I started this practice.</p>\n",

Oh, I know that two of the books on this list are probably vile works, written by vile people. And the other authors are famous personages and/or well-regarded writers, so they presumably have thick skins and reputations to protect them. But the gleeful responses of some of the people in the comments---I dunno:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the greatest read… Hilarious, I needed this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These aren’t fight scenes in action movies, or skirmishes at a hockey game. But that's how people react.</p>\n<p>Worse, to me, is when people try to emulate the “scathing reviewer” schtick on their Goodreads or other book social media reviews. Because often the target then isn’t an author so famous, or well-established. And then it’s not punching up, it’s a dunk on a real person and on their hard work. It’s insulting something/someone for the sake of entertainment. Or for aggrandizing oneself.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t like a book, you can write a reasonably polite negative review and move on. Or, just move on. There used to be a reviewer for — not <em>McSweeneys</em>, but some sister publication — who only did positive reviews. If they read a book they didn’t like, not only did they not review it, they wouldn’t even name it. “Life is too short to waste on bad books” was the mantra. It’s not everyone’s attitude, but I fall into that camp, myself.</p>\n",

Now we talk about an article <em>as</em> content---eliding the difference between a substantive, thoughtful piece of writing (or other creative act), and filler meant to keep the writer visible in their social media feeds. It's disrespectful of both creators and the works that they produce.</p>\n<p>So I now try to consciously avoid the word &quot;content&quot; as a synonym for a body of creative work. I try to use a specific word: &quot;posts,&quot; &quot;articles,&quot; &quot;writing,&quot; or even &quot;creative work.&quot;</p>\n<p>I don't want to get preachy about it, but I put this idea out there because I'd like to encourage other people who think like I do to do the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: Just as I was writing this post, Notion invited me to try their new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23460904/notion-ai-notes-writing-machine-learning\">&quot;AI writing buddy&quot;</a>.

			"content_html": "<p>Earlier today, my husband, who knows he can't spell, asked me how to spell &quot;dilemma.&quot; I spelled it to him out loud, the way I have always spelled the word: d-i-l-e-m-<strong>N</strong>-a. And I reflexively added, &quot;Google it, to make sure.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Here it is,&quot; he replied. &quot;Two Ms.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What?!? No, it's 'M-N'&quot;, I said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Google says two Ms.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>\n<p>I looked it up myself, positive that this was an instance of a mispelling/malapropism that had become more or less standard, or at least widely used, like people writing &quot;for all intensive purposes&quot; when they mean &quot;for all intents and purposes,&quot; or the surprisingly common &quot;defiantly&quot; in place of &quot;definitely.&quot;</p>\n<p>And I learned that in fact, it is, and has always been, &quot;dilemma.&quot; A quick trip to our actual, physical <em>Oxford Dictionary of American English</em> confirmed this.</p>\n<p>Now that I've stopped to think about it, two Ms makes sense. Di-lemma: two lemmas, or two &quot;propositions,&quot; to use <em>lemma</em> in its mathematical sense.  To <em>have a dilemma</em> is to be in a situation with two (or more) choices, and no way to choose among them, often because both are equally undesirable.</p>\n<p>So why did I think it was spelled with an N? &quot;Dilemma&quot; doesn't even look right to me. Clearly, I'm not the only one, given that <a href=\"https://www.dilemna.info/index.php\">an entire website exists</a> to discuss the issue. There's some kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_Effect\">Mandela effect</a> going on.</p>\n<p>Just for fun, let's entertain Fiona Broome's original theory about the Mandela effect: perhaps all of us who spell the word &quot;dilemna&quot; are refugees from some alternate reality where that spelling is, and has always been, correct.</p>\n<p>And now let's think about an old Grant Morrison graphic novel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JLA:_Earth_2\"><em>JLA: Earth 2</em></a> (there's a point to this, I promise). In that comic, there is another reality, Earth 2, where Superman, Wonder Woman, and all the rest of the Justice League instead belong to an evil group called the Crime Syndicate, and Alexander Luthor is the good guy fighting against them. And he loses, and will forever lose, to the Crime Syndicate -- just like &quot;our&quot; Lex Luthor always loses to the Justice League.</p>\n<p>Why? Because in the Earth 2 reality, the universe is biased in favor of evil. And in JLA's reality, the universe is biased in favor of good. As Martin Luther King, Jr. said, and President Obama quotes :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been thinking a lot about that comic over the last six or seven years. Because I'm really becoming afraid that we live on Earth 2.</p>\n<p>I wonder: on Earth 1, do they spell &quot;dilemna&quot; with an N?</p>\n<p>Because if they do, and if Philip K. Dick has taught me anything, we can turn this reality back to Earth 1, just by spelling &quot;dilemna&quot; with an N, too. Well, and a few other justice-affirming and ecologically responsible actions as well, but really, that N, it's gonna help!</p>\n<p>That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>P.S: On a more serious note, I do wonder if this widespread belief that it's &quot;dilemna,&quot; not &quot;dilemma&quot; could be a fluke of typography. Perhaps some type family somewhere had a ligature to represent <em>mm</em> that dropped a hump, so that <em>mm</em> looked more like <em>mn</em>.</p>\n<p>I admit this theory isn't any more substantiated than the alternate reality theory above, but it's possible...</p>\n",

But when the cooking was over and the time came, I decided: <em>screw it, I’d rather just sit and eat this</em>. Who cares, after all, except my husband and me, and maybe the people I might make this for in the future? And they can find out about it then.</p>\n<p>The above has always been my feeling about social media (and microblogging). <em>Why would anybody care?</em> I never saw the point of Twitter, for instance, unless one had a blog, or some other fount of creation (I won’t call it “content”), and one wanted to share their new creations with interested people in the world. Or even share other people’s interesting creations. And the kind of more personal stuff people often share on Facebook and equivalents (pictures of food, pictures of kids or pets…) — I do that too, but with my real-life, in-person friends: people who might actually care, because they know me. They know my context.</p>\n<p>Pundits sometimes deride social media as “performative,” but that’s not my issue. I have no problem “performing”— the reason I have so many blogs is to separate the various aspects of myself that I want to “perform” in public. My issue, I realized, is that social media is to a large degree <em>small talk</em>. And I hate small talk. I’ve never been good at it, I have trouble initiating it. I’ve gotten better at following through, but my gawd, it’s <em>work</em>.</p>\n<p>Coming to a new social media platform is like going to a big party where you don’t know anyone. Small talk is the medium by which you meet people in such a space, and so small talk, at first, is what I (try to) make. Some (most) people at a party like to chit chat to all kinds of new people, never staying with anyone for very long. It’s rude to monopolize their attention and time. I get that.</p>\n<p>But I really just want to find someone (a few someones) to <em>converse</em> with. Someone whose context I click with, or who clicks with my context. Hopefully both. And the few of us can stand in a corner and nerd out on the things we’re nerdy about to our heart’s content. Things our real-llfe friends may not find as interesting as we do (that’s why I came to this shindig in the first place, after all). We can share our long-form, short-form, medium-form posts with each other, knowing that those we share with may actually click, may actually <em>read</em>. And sometimes, at least, respond. Other people at the party will wander over, maybe join in the conversation for a bit until they’re bored, then wander off again. It’s fine.</p>\n<p>Will I find my peeps at this party? Or will I just stand alone by the hors d'oeuvre table, munching on the mini-samosas, talking to myself? Dunno. I guess I’ll find out.</p>\n",
