ðŸ’¬ A brief conversation with @annahavron inspired me to look up this wonderful Joan Didion quote:

> Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. ... What is going on in these pictures in my mind?

From "Why I Write" by Joan Didion. Originally given as a speech at her *alma mater* UC Berkeley, then published in the *New York Times Book Review*, December 1976. Currently collected in [*Let Me Tell You What I Mean*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/let-me-tell-you-what-i-mean-joan-didion/14871586), Knopf Publishing, 2021.

I love Joan Didion's writing.
