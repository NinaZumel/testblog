üçø In case you find it useful: some cool **non-subscription streaming sites (VOD)**:

* [Kino Now](https://kinonow.com/)- an eclectic collection of restored classics, as well as more recent films.

* [Flicker Alley](https://www.flickeralley.com/) - mostly produces physical format restorations of vintage cinema and lesser-known noir; but they have a limited selection of their catalog streaming VOD via Vimeo or Amazon Prime. 

These are only interesting if you are into this kind of film, of course, but they can be useful supplements to whatever regular streaming services you use.

Our household only subscribes to Amazon Prime (and PBS Masterpiece via Prime). We aren't interested in subscribing to All The Things. If I were to add one more, it would probably be [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/).

We're also a household with a huge Blu-Ray/DVD collection. As you might guess, Kino, Flicker Alley, and Criterion form a big part of that collection.
