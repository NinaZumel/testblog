ðŸ“š New winter tale! ["The Ghost of Charlotte Cray"](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2022/12/15/the-ghost-of-charlotte-cray/) is a lighter-hearted story by Florence Marryat, author of _The Blood of the Vampire_. It's also a warning that playboy-types should be more careful in their relationships. Enjoy!
