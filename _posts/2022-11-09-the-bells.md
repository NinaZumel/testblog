ðŸŽ¥ [The Bells](https://archive.org/details/THEBELLS1926SilentLionelBarrymoreBorisKarloff) is a 1926 silent film starring Lionel Barrymore and featuring Boris Karloff in what should have been his breakout role. I watched it because I'm a Karloff fan -- it's pretty good, except the ending. It's based on an 1867 French play by Erckmann-Chatrian, and I found the [English adaptation](http://gaslight-lit.s3-website.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/gaslight/thebells.htm). The play's ending is much better.
