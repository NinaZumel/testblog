The reason I made my own microblogging site is so that I can announce my new long-form posts with an introduction. The stark "title + link" format I get by syndicating my blogs directly on Micro.blog isn't very friendly, or attractive.

For casual chat, a static Jekyll site isn't the best way to microblog; it cuts down on the spontaneity. But I've never been a chatty person anyway. This will suit most of my microblogging needs just fine.

And now I can disconnect most of my other direct blog feeds to Micro.blog.
