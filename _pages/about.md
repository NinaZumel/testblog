*Short Thoughts* is my personal microblogging site. I use it to share what I've written across all my long-form blogs, and to post quick little musings.

### My Blogs

[Multo(Ghost)](https://multoghost.wordpress.com): my primary blog, where I blog about the supernatural in literature and popular culture. You'll find ghost stories, folklore, and whatever I feel like writing about.

[Ephemera](https://exiw.wordpress.com): Lately, I've been using this blog mostly for my translations of public domain, Spanish language supernatural short fiction.

[Dark Tales Sleuth](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com): A blog I use for my forays into "literary sleuthing": tracking down author attributions and original publication sources of unattributed (usually public domain) works.

[NinaZumel.com](https://ninazumel.com): My professional presence online, where I sometimes write about data science and other technical interests.
