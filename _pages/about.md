title: "About Short Thoughts"
---

I have a lot of long-form blogs, to cover a variety of related interests. *Short Thoughts* serves as my personal microblogging site, a one-stop shop to publicize what I've written across all my blogs. And sometimes to share quick little musings, as well.

### My Blogs

[Multo(Ghost)](https://multoghost.wordpress.com): my primary blog, where I blog about the supernatural in literature and popular culture. Ghost stories, folklore, and whatever I feel like writing about.

[Ephemera](https://exiw.wordpress.com): Lately, I've been using this blog mostly for my translations of public domain, Spanish language supernatural short fiction.

[Dark Tales Sleuth](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com): A blog I use for my forays into "literary sleuthing": tracking down author attributions and original publication sources of unattributed (usually public domain) works.

[NinaZumel.com](https://ninazumel.com): My professional presence online.
