This site is made with Jekyll, and is based on the [Tail](https://github.com/jitinnair1/tail) theme, tweaked for a more microblog-friendly format. 

I took some inspiration from the [gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio) and [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) themes, as well.
